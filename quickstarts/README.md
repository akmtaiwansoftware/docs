# Murano Quickstarts Overview

Quickstarts are example templates to help you create Products and Solutions on Murano in the shortest way possible. This includes everything you need to set up a Product, connect a simulated device, interact with device data on a custom dashboard, and deploy a fully customizable front-end web application Solution. When finished, you will have a complete end-to-end IoT application deployed on Exositeâ€™s Murano platform.
