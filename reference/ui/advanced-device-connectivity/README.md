The *Devices* page is where you will add, list, and manage all your devices (real or simulated).
Once you have populated your list of devices, you will have the capability to search, sort, and filter you device list to suit your needs. 

When you click “+ NEW DEVICE(S)”, you will have the option to add one device or many devices at once (note: free Murano accounts limit the number of devices you are able to add).
