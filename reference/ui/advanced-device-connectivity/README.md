When you click “+ NEW DEVICE(S)”, you will have the option to add one device or many devices at once (note: free Murano accounts limit the number of devices you are able to add).

**NOTE:** the *Endpoint* URL at the top of the screen is the host name that has been created to receive your devices' outgoing API calls.
