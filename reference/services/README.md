# Solution Service Reference

This page describes the services available in the Murano platform.  Services are composed by two distinct components: **operations** and **events**.  

* **Operations** are functions that can directly be called from within a script.
* **Events** trigger the execution of a script.

Handling of Service Events and calling of Service Operations are performed with [Murano scripting](../scripting).
