# Murano Platform Overview

Murano helps organizations connect product deployments and build applications and services using a secure, scalable infrastructure. The easiest way to think about the Murano platform is as a number of cloud software layers that are integrated together, simplifying the full IoT stack. Murano has taken care of the infrastructure, development, and integration of the functional layers, including device connectivity, device/product management, data routing, service integration (with services like data stores, alerting, and third-party analytics platforms), application public APIs, user auth/roles/permissions, and application asset hosting.

Murano also allows integration with third-party software and other server-based systems, allowing developers to focus on user-application-specific functionality and device applications, while achieving a faster time to market than would be possible if building a platform from scratch.
Murano allows developers to build full IoT systems quickly, while maintaining the flexibility to add new features and build customizations not possible on more rigid platforms.

Murano uses a micro-services architecture managed by an ISO-27001 information security program, and provides support, status, and developer-operations interfaces that many of the world's top organizations rely on as an integral part of their IoT operations.
