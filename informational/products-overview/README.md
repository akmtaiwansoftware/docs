# Products Overview

The Product concept in Murano represents a connected device type. It provides tools and interfaces to manage product definitions, allowing developers to deploy a fleet of devices using a common API hostname, provisioning sequence, definition for data routing, and content for things like infield updates and configuration. Developers can quickly build devices and verify device behavior using integrated prototyping dashboards.
