# Embedded Products Overview

Exosite has two main software packages for embedded systems, ExositeReady™ Embedded SDK and ExositeReady™ Gateway Engine.

## ExositeReady Embedded SDK

The ExositeReady™ Embedded SDK is an open-source software framework, written in ANSI C, containing application software for controlling devices’ communication with the Exosite platform. It compiles various third-party libraries for basic protocol functionality as well as implementing all the common logic needed to interact with the platform. Exosite also provides several ports to select hardware platforms, including various application examples, to accelerate your application development. The SDK is for engineers developing firmware for their embedded device products. It is generally targeted for use in creating end-node devices and not gateways.

## ExositeReady Gateway Engine

ExositeReady Gateway Engine is a software package that is intended to run on Linux-class industrial gateway devices and bridge the gap between IoT devices, sensors, systems, and equipment to the cloud.

ExositeReady Gateway Engine key features:

ExositeReady GWE Key Features

Application hosting –GWE allows customers to build and monitor custom gateway applications, control versioning, define restart and fail characteristics, and retrieve debug logs.

* *OTA updates* – GWE enables customers to remotely install and update gateway firmware or applications using a secure, reliable OTA engine.

* *Message queuing* – GWE helps customers avoid data loss due to power outages or lossy networks with a flexible, store-and-forward style HTTP server.

* *Modular sensor interface* – GWE provides default sensor drivers or allows I/O interfaces to be added and extended to meet the demands of each unique implementation.

* *Pluggable services interface* – GWE provides built-in cloud modules to route device data to Exosite’s Murano platform or easily integrate with other on-premise business and building-management systems.
