# Integrations Overview

The Murano services framework is responsible for executing upon operations and events defined and required by the IoT Solution.  For example, the [Email Service](/murano/services/email/), is responsible for configuring, sending, and receiving emails on behalf of an IoT Solution.

Murano has a set of core services available to every solution, and more are continually being made available in response to market needs. In addition to the core services that Murano offers, custom integrations can be created that allow for additional down-stream services required by the specific IoT Solution needs.
