# Applications Overview

The Solution concept in Murano represents the application logic, user interfaces, and APIs for an IoT application. It provides the tools needed to build and deploy applications and services on top of IoT device data using concepts of data routing, integrated services, custom APIs, user auth/roles/permissions, and application asset hosting. This allows developers to create solution templates that contain the entire application functionality to deploy to end users or to provide a custom API for their products.
